# Web Scraping Mars data from NASA using Jupyter Notebook
BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.

## Using MongoDB and Flask to display the data as HTML/CSS
MongoDB database was used to store data from the web scrape, and then a web application was created with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.

The Python code from the scraping file may differ slightly from the Jupyter Notebook Mission to Mars Challenge file.  Some variables needed to be changed to match other files
